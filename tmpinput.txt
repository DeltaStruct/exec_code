2025-05-15T10:18:47Z INF Thank you for trying Cloudflare Tunnel. Doing so, without a Cloudflare account, is a quick way to experiment and try it out. However, be aware that these account-less Tunnels have no uptime guarantee, are subject to the Cloudflare Online Services Terms of Use (https://www.cloudflare.com/website-terms/), and Cloudflare reserves the right to investigate your use of Tunnels for violations of such terms. If you intend to use Tunnels in production you should use a pre-created named tunnel by following: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps

You might need to add that user to a group within that range, or instead update the range to encompass a group the user is already in by modifying /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ping_group_range.
